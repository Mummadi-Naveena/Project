Cardiac arrhythmia detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) involves analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to classify abnormal heart rhythms. CNNs excel at recognizing patterns in time-series data like ECGs, identifying arrhythmias by detecting subtle variations in signal morphology. This automated approach helps in early diagnosis, enabling quick and accurate identification of potentially life-threatening conditions. The use of CNNs reduces the need for manual analysis, improving efficiency and accuracy in clinical settings.
