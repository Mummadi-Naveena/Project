I’m M.Naveena, and this repository showcases my projects focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Here, you’ll find a variety of AI/ML applications ranging from healthcare-focused models, like the automated detection of cardiac arrhythmia using deep learning, to multi-agent systems for job matching and preference analysis. Each project emphasizes practical applications of AI to solve real-world problems, using frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and tools like fuzzy logic and agent-based modeling. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out for collaboration!
